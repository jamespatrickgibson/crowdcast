# Crowdcast

Find out which bars and restaurants have small crowds and short lines in the era of social distancing.

_Note: The app is currently populated with static data and assets. During the hack:now event, it was wired up to an API powered by Flask, Google Places API and Google Photo API_

## hack:now Submission

Crowdcast was a our submission for Hack:now, the all-online 36-hour global hackathon that ran from April 24-26. This event was hosted by the team from Cal Hacks, the world's largest collegiate hackathon with ~2000 attendees held annually at UC Berkeley and run by the student group Hack the Bay in partnership with CITRIS Foundary.

## What It Does

We created an app called Crowdcast that takes your current location, searches for nearby bars, and detects how busy each venue is in real-time using computer vision. In particular, it can track how many people are currently at a given establishment, and it can also track how many people are waiting in line outside (as well as how long the wait time would be). Why head to a bar with your friends without knowing how packed it will be? Crowdcast searches all nearby bars and provides you with real-time knowledge if the bar you intended to go to is actually a feasible option.
